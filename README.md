## Overview

CineBox is designed to work seamlessly in high-speed intranet/broadband environments, particularly BDIX networks, where content is hosted on direct HTTP servers. The front end is fully responsive, lightweight, and functions both as a traditional web portal and as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA).

The user interface follows a modern glassmorphism design language with ambient glow backdrops, intuitive video controls, YouTube-style settings panels, and dedicated touch gestures for mobile devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0 or higher recommended)
- Python 3 (optional, required only for running crawler scripts)

### Installation and Running

Clone the repository and launch the built-in development server:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shahriyarshehab/cinebox.git
cd cinebox

# Start local server
npm start

# Or start in development mode (auto-opens default browser)
npm run dev
```

The server will bind to `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port if 3000 is occupied).

### Server CLI Options

The custom server implementation (`server.js`) includes built-in command-line arguments:

```bash
# Run on a custom port
node server.js --port 8080
# Or using the shorthand:
node server.js -p 8080

# Auto-launch default browser
node server.js --open
# Or using the shorthand:
node server.js -o
```

## Core Systems

### Audio DSP and Channel Splitting Engine

The dedicated audio engine (`js/audio-engine.js`) interfaces directly with the Web Audio API to provide advanced audio processing:

1. Volume Booster: A GainNode amplification chain allows volume to be increased safely up to 300% without hard digital clipping.
2. Equalizer Profiles:
   - Standard: Flat response curve.
   - Dialogue Enhancer: Peaking filter at 2.5 kHz (+6 dB, Q=1.2) coupled with dynamic compression to prioritize dialogue intelligibility.
   - Bass Cinema: Low-shelf filter at 120 Hz (+7 dB) for low-end theatrical resonance.
   - Night Mode: Aggressive dynamic compression (12:1 ratio, -32 dB threshold) to normalize explosions and soft whisper scenes.
3. Dual-Audio Stereo Channel Splitting: Many video files encode different audio languages on separate channels of a single stereo track (e.g., Hindi on Channel 0, English on Channel 1). Using `ChannelSplitterNode` and `ChannelMergerNode`, CineBox can route either the left or right channel to both speakers, effectively acting as an audio track selector for dual-audio media.
4. External Audio Sync: Synchronize external `.mp3` or `.aac` tracks with on-screen video, with sub-second offset adjustments (`+0.1s` / `-0.1s`).

### Adaptive Streaming and Server Failover

When a video begins playback, CineBox constructs an array of server mirrors based on known BDIX server clusters (DhakaFlix, SamOnline, Elaach, Triangle). 

- If an HLS `.m3u8` stream is detected, `Hls.js` is dynamically instantiated with low-latency worker threads and buffer management.
- Standard MP4/WebM files stream directly through native HTML5 elements with Range header support for instantaneous scrubbing.
- If the primary server node fails or returns an error, playback automatically switches to the next available mirror seamlessly.

### Mother Server Connection Monitoring

When streaming from BDIX networks, private intranet servers (`172.16.50.x`) may become unreachable if the user is connected to mobile data or an unpeered ISP. CineBox includes:

- Watchdog Timer: A 12-second connection watchdog detects silent packet drops where browsers fail to trigger native error events.
- Error Modal: If all server mirrors fail, a modal appears inside the player explaining the issue, displaying the target server address, and providing direct buttons to retry, cycle mirrors, or open the link in external media players.

### Subtitles and VTT Synchronization

- Drag-and-Drop: Drop any `.srt` or `.vtt` file directly onto the player window.
- Auto-Conversion: `.srt` files are parsed and transformed in real-time into WebVTT blobs for native track display.
- Sync Controls: Live offset adjustments (`+0.5s` / `-0.5s`) without requiring video reloading.
- Visual Customization: Real-time controls for font size, font color, background style (translucent, solid, outline, shadow), and vertical positioning.

### TV Series and Season Explorer

For episodic content, CineBox resolves seasons and episodes using `tv_index.json`. Features include:

- Multi-Season Navigation: Tabbed season selection with instant episode counts.
- Autoplay Next Episode: A countdown prompt overlays 10 seconds before an episode ends, allowing continuous viewing.
- Episode Filter: Live search field inside the season drawer to quickly find specific episodes by title or episode number.

### External Player and Download Hub

Users who prefer dedicated desktop or mobile media players can launch streams directly:

- One-Click Launchers: Deep link handlers for VLC Media Player (`vlc://`), MX Player (`intent:`), and PotPlayer (`potplayer://`).
- Batch Playlist Export: Generate and download `.m3u` playlists containing all season episodes for media center importing.
- Mobile Downloaders: Integration with 1DM and ADM download managers for multi-threaded chunk downloading.

## Automation and Data Scraping

The repository includes Python crawling utilities located in the `scripts/` directory:

- `scripts/auto_update.py`: Crawls upstream mother servers, parses release directories, categorizes entries, generates `data/latest.json` and `data/today.json`, and updates `home_data.json`.
- `scripts/crawl_tv_episodes.py`: Recursively maps television series season directories and generates structured episode lists.
- `scripts/compress_tv_index.py`: Minifies and optimizes the television index for low bandwidth delivery.

To manually trigger a catalog synchronization:

```bash
npm run update
# Or directly:
python scripts/auto_update.py
```

## Security and Code Quality

The codebase enforces strict defensive engineering standards:

- XSS Prevention: All dynamic strings, titles, actor names, and URLs pass through `escapeHtml()` and `sanitizeUrl()` before rendering into the DOM.
- Path Traversal Guard: The Node.js static server verifies that requested relative file paths strictly resolve inside the application root directory.
- Service Worker Architecture: Static assets employ a Stale-While-Revalidate strategy to prevent cache trapping and ensure updates deploy immediately on client revisit.
- Linter Verification: All JavaScript files are syntax-verified via `npm run lint`:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
